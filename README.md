## 🎯 What is N4V FOR WEBI?

**N4V FOR WEBI** is a comprehensive extension suite developed by [Need4Viz](https://www.need4viz.com) that dramatically enhances SAP BusinessObjects Web Intelligence (WebI) capabilities. It solves the most common frustrations WebI users face: limited visualizations, no geographic mapping, static exports, and complex query building.

### The Problem

SAP WebI is powerful for data analysis but limited in visualization options. Users often resort to exporting data to Excel or third-party tools, breaking the BI workflow and creating version control issues.

### The Solution

N4V FOR WEBI adds enterprise-grade visualization capabilities **directly inside WebI**, maintaining data governance, security, and the familiar SAP environment.
